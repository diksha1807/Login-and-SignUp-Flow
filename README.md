# Login-and-SignUp-Flow
This app flow begins with a splash screen offering “Create an account” or “Login.” The login screen allows users to enter phone number and password, with options for Google or Apple sign-in. The create account screen collects name, phone number, and password, enabling seamless onboarding and quick sign-in for new and returning users.
